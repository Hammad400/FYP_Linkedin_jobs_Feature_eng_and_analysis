As it is noticed during analysis of 26 sep to 9 oct that onsite-remote information are in existing in both columns :Job info and job type
so i had generated two features 'Remote/Onsite' from 'job info' and 'Remote/Onsite-2' from 'job type'

so on 7th december it is investigated that pattern changed on 9th october file at 119th row of Excel and expected 117th index of 9th october file.

It is confirmed by manually exploring Excel files of week 2 and week 3 that before this onsite remote is in 'job info' feature and after that remote onsite is 
in 'job type' feature 

I also confirmed that if onsite-remote is not mentioned then there is only one element in 'job type' that is Fulltime etc and onsite-remote is not present
in 'job info' feature
