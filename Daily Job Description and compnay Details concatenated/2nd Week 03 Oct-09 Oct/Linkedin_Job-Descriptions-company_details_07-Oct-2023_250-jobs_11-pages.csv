UN Women endeavors to expand the reach and enhance the quality of services available to survivors of violence using the Essential Services Package (ESP). The ESP is a global guideline to support national systems in responding to gender-based violence and encompasses the core elements of health, social services, police, and justice sectors, and provides guidelines for coordination, governance, and resource estimation.Recently the Government of Pakistan promulgated three sets of rules under section 19 of the Anti-Rape Act in February 2023 that cover Investigation, Trial & Procedure, and Anti-Rape Crisis Cell & Medico-legal. This legislation is critical in strengthening the justice sector's responses to VAWG. In view of supporting this critical legislation, UN Women is seeking to engage a consultant to develop a curriculum and train a pool of master trainers from justice service providers namely the Police, Medico-Legal, Forensics, and Prosecution on evidence collection, medical examination, investigation and trial including issues faced by Women with Disabilities (WwD) and Transwomen.
