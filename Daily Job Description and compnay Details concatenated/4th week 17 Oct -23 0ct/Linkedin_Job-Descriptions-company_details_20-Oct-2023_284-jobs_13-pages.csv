Due to a variety of factors, the proportion of refugees and internally displaced persons in protracted displacement situations remains high. Moreover, the diminishing number of forcibly displaced people who have access to so-called durable solutions constitutes a worrying trend that has persisted in recent years. The increasing scale of irregular migration, large scale refugee movements, internal displacement and the costs of responding to humanitarian situations have placed forced displacement high on the global agenda. Given the complexity and protractedness of many of today¿s forced displacement situations, often occurring in fragile contexts, awareness is growing that the humanitarian model of care and maintenance is unsustainable in the longer term and that forced displacement requires a development response to complement humanitarian assistance, address poverty and other development challenges in a sustainable and inclusive manner. The SDGs provide a yardstick for inclusive development based on the principles of Leaving No One Behind and Reaching the Furthest Behind First. It is also acknowledged that extreme poverty and human suffering associated with refugees and other forcibly displaced people need to be systematically taken into account existing when addressing development challenges and development prospects of host communities, countries, and regions.The Global Compact for Refugees frames this new approach towards a more predictable and equitable responsibility-sharing, recognizing that more sustainable approaches to refugee situations cannot be achieved without the systematic engagement of a broader set of stakeholders, including development partners.Among the most significant humanitarian-development cooperation partnerships strengthened in recent years has been between the World Bank and UNHCR on forced displacement. In the eighteenth replenishment (2017-2020) of the World Bank¿s International Development Association (IDA), which provides financing for low-income countries, an amount of US$ 2.2 billion has been included for those states receiving large numbers of refugees (Sub-Window for Refugees and Host-Communities). The IDA 18 allocation follows the operationalization of a Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF) for Middle-Income Countries (MICs) affected by large numbers of refugees. In addition, UNHCR has enhanced cooperation with the private sector wing of the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and bilateral development donor.Within the context outlined above, the role of the Senior Development Officer is to support UNHCR's engagement and cooperation with development agencies¿ medium-term programmes assisting local communities and UNHCR's population of concern and the ability to leverage development partnerships to influence policy dialogue to enact institutional reforms toward improved protection environments, socio-economic inclusion, and self-reliance; taking into account and reducing the vulnerabilities of forcibly displaced persons. As such, the incumbent needs to have practical experience working with and an understanding of the interplay of different aspects of economic growth, governance, fragility and conflict, the main factors that influence the environment for inclusion and resilience for UNHCR¿s population of concern. Depending on the operating environments in the area of responsibility (AoR), the incumbent might need to have specific expertise in areas such as social protection, governance in fragile contexts, local governance and community development. It is anticipated that development responses to forced displacement will grow in significance in future years due to the greater importance attached to fragility and addressing protracted displacement situations. The incumbent will assist in identifying potential opportunities and ensure complementarity between UNHCR's protection work and the economic and social development objectives pursued by development partners and their government counterparts.

Due to a variety of factors, the proportion of Afghan refugees in a protracted displacement situation within Pakistan remains high. Given the complexity and protracted nature of the refugee issue in Pakistan, and the fragile context of solutions therein; awareness is growing that the standalone humanitarian model of care and maintenance is unsustainable and that protracted displacement also requires a complementary development response that can help address the social protection issues such as poverty, access to basic services and the challenges related to ensuring a conducive co-existence and community resilience alongside host communities. The SDGs provide a yardstick for inclusive development based on the principles of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ and ‘Reaching the Furthest Behind First’. It is acknowledged that extreme poverty and human suffering associated with refugees and other forcibly displaced people need to be systematically considered when addressing development challenges and development prospects of host communities in the districts and provinces where their numbers are particularly high.The Global Compact for Refugees frames this approach towards a more predictable and equitable responsibility-sharing, recognizing that more sustainable approaches to refugee situations cannot be achieved without the systematic engagement of a broader set of stakeholders, including development partners.In Pakistan the UNSDF is the UN’s medium-term 5-year strategic planning framework for collaboration with the Government of Pakistan (2023–2027). It articulates the shared purpose of that partnership: delivering as one to achieve the SDGs. UNHCR is an active member of the One UN Team and increasingly involved in and contributing to the work of the Outcome Groups.Among the most significant humanitarian-development cooperation partnerships strengthened by UNHCR in recent years has been with the World Bank. Over the recent years, the World Bank Group (WBG) has scaled up its efforts to support refugees and refugee-hosting communities, through the IDA19 Window for Host Communities and Refugees (WHR). This is an integral part of the WBG’s engagement in refugee-hosting countries and it is one of the pillars of the recent WBG Strategy on Fragility, Conflict, and Violence. The WBG’s support aims to complement humanitarian interventions by focusing on the medium-term socioeconomic dimensions of displacement for both refugees and their hosts. It is part of a broader international effort to encourage the adoption of sound government policies for the management of forced displacement situations, which underpins the 2018 Global Compact on Refugees (GCR). Additionally, UNHCR has enhanced cooperation with the Asia Development Bank (ADB), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other development partners and donors.Living and Working Conditions:Islamabad is a category C family duty station.
