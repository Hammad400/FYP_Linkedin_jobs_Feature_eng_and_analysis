BackgroundUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) strives to promote gender equality and women’s human rights, strengthen implementation of gender sensitive policy and legislation and eliminate all forms of violence against women. Attention is given to issues of excluded groups and their capacity to lobby so that these become part of mainstream decision making and planning. UN Women provides technical advisory and services regarding women’s economic empowerment, ending violence against women and girls, women’s leadership and participation, and gender integration in planning and budgeting. It works towards ensuring an effective UN response by strengthening the effectiveness, coordination, and quality of outputs on gender equality amongst the various stakeholders.Duties And ResponsibilitiesUN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security. UN Women, with financial assistance from Embassy of Federal Republic of Germany, has recently launched a project ‘Improving Gender Parity for Strengthening Gender Responsive Justice in Pakistan’. In order to improve women’s access to quality and survivor-centered justice, it is important to increase women’s participation and trust in the justice system. It is crucial to enhance women’s role and their involvement in the sector for strengthening gender-responsive justice in Pakistan. This project aims to strengthen delivery of gender-responsive justice by increasing gender parity within the justice sector institutions including Police, Judiciary, Bar and the Prosecution in the ICT, Khyber Pakhtunkhwah and Balochistan. There is a dire need to improve the working environment, so that women are incentivized to join and pursue a career in the security sector. To this end, gender-responsive facilities, and policies based on GRB guidelines are needed to facilitate women—especially recruitment policies of the police, levies force, judiciary and the bar councils. This will be done by improving the gender parity in these institutions and also by engaging the existing force in deeper dialogue and capacity building around gender responsive policing. The proposed initiative will help these institutions to improve their understanding and facilitate a conducive environment for professional growth of women in workforce with more focus on training and implementation of anti-harassment policies and human handling and gender sensitization. Mentoring opportunities for the women in these institutions will be supported to catalyse the reform processes like relaxation in recruitment criteria, age limit etc.UN Women requires the services of a Training Specialist to design and deliver the orientation/sensitization sessions for women Police officials who aspire to join the peacekeeping missions. The consultant in consultation with the existing peacekeepers especially from the Police force will develop a manual to conduct these orientation/sensitization sessions. These sessions will essentially deliver information on requirements, procedures and nature of job for those who want to become part of peacekeeping missions particularly for women aspirants. Following the development of this manual, the consultant will deliver 2 two-days orientation/sensitization sessions for women police officials from KP and Balochistan. During these sessions, the consultant will also engage the existing peacekeepers who can provide hands-on information and share their experiences.The assignment aims to provide orientation and mentoring support to women police officials to become part of peacekeeping missions so not only gender parity is enhanced in these missions, but women also gain new knowledge and skills to progress in their careers. The specific objectives are as follows: Providing women police officials orientation on requirements, procedures and nature of job for peacekeeping missionsProviding women police officials an opportunity to interact with existing (or those who have served) in peacekeeping missions to share experiences and extend mentoring supportMobilizing women to become part of these missions –whenever the opportunity arises – for enhancing gender parity as well as their own career growthS.No

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy’s finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don’t run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We’re different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was “The Future of Work” and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don’t need to be an asynchronous work expert. You simply need to be hard-working and hands-on, have solid accounting and finance fundamentals (US GAAP or IFRS), and love to automate and simplify processes. We will teach you the rest!What You Will Be Doing Completing transactions, preparing reports, building quotes, invoices, and purchase orders, applying incoming payments, managing cash positions, and paying suppliersLeading with your finance systems expertise; you will guide the team with the finance systems experience you’ve gained over the years and simplify the most complex tasks

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy’s finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don’t run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We’re different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was “The Future of Work” and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don’t need to be an asynchronous work expert.
