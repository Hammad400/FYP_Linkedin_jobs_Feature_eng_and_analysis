Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.What You Will Be Doing Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
Basic RequirementsArtificial Intelligence Engineer key responsibilities Minimum 5 years of experience in software development.Minimum 3 years as a primary technical contributor for a development team or software product.Extensive hands-on experience using generative AI for software engineering tasks or in a product you built.

BackgroundIntroductionUN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.In Pakistan, the agency’s work is guided by the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) and the UN Women Pakistan Strategic Note (SN). In the context of advancing gender equality and women empowerment objectives, both key documents focus on the following five areas: (1) normative frameworks and data, (2) innovative gender financing, (3) protection against harmful practices, (4) awareness, voice, agency and leadership, and (5) women economic empowerment. While aligning perfectly with the Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment outcome of the UNSDCF, the Strategic Note also recognizes the interconnectedness of various development goals and the pivotal role of gender equality in achieving sustainable development, as envisioned under the UNSDCF. It thus promotes the integration of a gender perspective across all sectors, fostering collaboration with government institutions, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to implement gender-responsive policies and programs.Unlocking women’s economic potential in Pakistan remains a key area of focus for UN Women, and is in line with the priorities of the Government of Pakistan, as reflected in the latter’s framework for national development, the Pakistan Vision 2025. Vision 2025 plans for Pakistan to be “in the league of Upper Middle-Income countries by 2025” and “amongst the top ten economies of the world by 2047”. Any solution to Pakistan’s economic and social problems cannot succeed without including its women, who make up 48.5 percent of the total population of the country and are thus indispensable to its future growth story. To achieve these goals, it is paramount that Pakistani women are enabled to reach their full potential by virtue of active participation in economic life.JustificationVarious initiatives by key government departments and institutions, including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA), are reflective of the focus on the economic empowerment of women. In this regard, SMEDA, has also established a Women Entrepreneurship Development Cell (WED Cell) to address gender-specific challenges and promote gender mainstreaming.The primary objective of the WED Cell is to highlight the unique obstacles faced by women entrepreneurs and create an enabling environment that optimizes their success at every stage of business development, consolidation, and growth. WED Cell also facilitates communication and collaboration among decision-makers, government agencies, donors, and women entrepreneurs, to strengthen the overall framework for women's entrepreneurship by making recommendations and proposing strategies to reduce barriers and enhance support mechanisms for women entrepreneurs.However, through experiences and the lessons learned from the National SME Policy 2021, and the findings of a recent Diagnostic Study on Key Barriers to Women Entrepreneurs in Pakistan, there is a need for a dedicated Women Entrepreneurship Development (WED) policy, accompanied by collective efforts and a supportive ecosystem. Such a policy is crucial for sustainable and inclusive economic growth and business consolidation in the women micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector.Recognizing the significant potential and untapped opportunities that lies within women entrepreneurship, UN Women aims to support SMEDA to develop a comprehensive Women Entrepreneurship Development Policy to harness this potential and foster women entrepreneurship in Pakistan.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.What You Will Be Doing Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
Basic RequirementsAI Super Engineer key responsibilities Minimum 5 years of experience in software development.Minimum 3 years as a primary technical contributor for a development team or software product.Extensive hands-on experience using generative AI for software engineering tasks or in a product you built.
About TrilogyHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses.
