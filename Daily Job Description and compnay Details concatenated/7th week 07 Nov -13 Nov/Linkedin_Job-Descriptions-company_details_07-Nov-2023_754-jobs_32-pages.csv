Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units.

BackgroundViolence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread human rights violations worldwide, globally affecting around one in three women in her lifetime. UN Women endeavors to expand the reach and enhance the quality of services available to survivors of violence through the use of the Essential Services Package (ESP). The ESP is a global guideline to support national systems in responding to gender-based violence encompasses the core elements of health, social services, police, and justice sectors, and provides guidelines for coordination, governance, and resource estimation. During an emergency and its aftermath, access to lifesaving care and support is unpredictable, vulnerability to violence is higher, and systems that protect women and girls, including family, community, and state structures, may weaken or break down. As a consequence, the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) increases due to the multiple risk factors created by emergencies as well as the ways in which existing gender inequalities are exacerbated by the stress and tensions within households, communities, and society.As per the worldwide climate index, Pakistan ranks as the 8th most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change. The variability in climate and weather patterns has increased the frequency of natural disasters which undermine development in Pakistan and in particular, the ability of national and local systems to respond to GBV. According to Care International’s Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) Key Findings and Recommendations on the 2022 floods, access to life-saving resources and services has been strained; the health crisis amplified; and gender-based violence has increased with time. Moreover, men are more likely to receive humanitarian services first.UN Women is seeking a consultant to adapt the ESP for emergency preparedness and programming for Pakistan that will enable national and local systems to ensure a consistent approach to responding to GBV during emergencies.Duties And ResponsibilitiesUnder the direct supervision of Programme Specialist, ROL and Governance, the consultant will be required to do the following tasks: Review and analyze the Essential Services Package (ESP) to understand the framework, principles, standards, and minimum requirements for essential service provision for women and girls survivors of violence.Develop a training module adapting the ESP to emergencies tailored to fit the national context of Pakistan.Develop guidelines for trainers to impart trainings.Conduct a training session(s) based on the training module developed.Sr No.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!What You Will Be Doing Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.
What You Won’t Be Doing Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy’s finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don’t run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We’re different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was “The Future of Work” and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don’t need to be an asynchronous work expert. You simply need to be hard-working and hands-on, have solid accounting and finance fundamentals (US GAAP or IFRS), and love to automate and simplify processes. We will teach you the rest!What You Will Be Doing Completing transactions, preparing reports, building quotes, invoices, and purchase orders, applying incoming payments, managing cash positions, and paying suppliersLeading with your finance systems expertise; you will guide the team with the finance systems experience you’ve gained over the years and simplify the most complex tasks
What You Won’t Be Doing Project managing the work of low-level managers; we lead by doing, not by being hands-offOverseeing steady-state operations; you will never stop improving quality and productivity with deep knowledge and hard evidence
Basic RequirementsDirector of Financial Planning and Analysis key responsibilities CPA, ACA, ACCA, CIMA, CFA, MBA, or equivalent5+ years of hands-on experience in all of the following areas: Accounts Payable (or PTP), Accounts Receivable (or OTC), Accounting (or RTR), Statutory/Management ReportingRecent experience as an auditor or controller (if you haven't posted a transaction, built a financial model, or automated a process within the last year, please do not apply)Professional experience working with NetsuiteFamiliarity with generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, Claude)The ability to commit to 40 hours of work per week with a regular, predictable work schedule
