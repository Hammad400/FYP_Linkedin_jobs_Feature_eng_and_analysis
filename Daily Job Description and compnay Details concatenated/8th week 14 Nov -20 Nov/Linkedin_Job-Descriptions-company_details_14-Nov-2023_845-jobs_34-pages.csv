NOTE: This vacancy is being re-advertised with the aim of expanding the pool of candidates. Previous applicants need not re-apply.The Position:The Humanitarian Programme Specialist will support the development of the Country Office’s humanitarian strategy and the repositioning of its implementation on resilience building and innovation. They will work under the direct supervision of the Humanitarian Coordinator, and in close coordination with UNFPA programme and operations team at Islamabad and Provincial offices.How you can make a difference:UNFPA is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled. UNFPA’s new strategic plan (2022-2025), focuses on accelerating progress towards the achievement of UNFPA’s three ‘transformative results’: to end preventable maternal deaths; end unmet need for family planning; and end gender-based violence and harmful practices.UNFPA under the 10th Country Programme Document (2023-2027) envisages to contribute to resilience building by strengthening institutional, community and individual capacities to prepare for and respond to future threats including natural disasters and emergencies. UNFPA has a long-standing partnerships and humanitarian presence in the country, working in close collaboration with the federal and provincial government institutions, non-governmental organizations and other humanitarian actors to prioritize provision of lifesaving sexual and reproductive health, and gender-based violence risk mitigation and response services. Existing programmes, including for the flood response in 2022 in affected areas are being pivoted to ensure continued provision of essential services.Following the lessons learned in the current humanitarian situation in the country for response and preparedness plans, UNFPA intends to scale up the humanitarian response and preparedness actions by using different approaches. Creative thinking and innovative solutions are key to accelerate progress for women and girls around the world. During conflicts, natural disasters and public health emergencies, sexual and reproductive health needs are often overlooked – with staggering consequences. Pregnant women risk life-threatening complications without access to safe delivery and emergency obstetric care services.

NOTE: This vacancy is being re-advertised with the aim of expanding the pool of candidates. Previous applicants need not re-apply.The Position:The Humanitarian Programme Specialist will support the development of the Country Office’s humanitarian strategy and the repositioning of its implementation on resilience building and innovation. They will work under the direct supervision of the Humanitarian Coordinator, and in close coordination with UNFPA programme and operations team at Islamabad and Provincial offices.How you can make a difference:UNFPA is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled. UNFPA’s new strategic plan (2022-2025), focuses on accelerating progress towards the achievement of UNFPA’s three ‘transformative results’: to end preventable maternal deaths; end unmet need for family planning; and end gender-based violence and harmful practices.UNFPA under the 10th Country Programme Document (2023-2027) envisages to contribute to resilience building by strengthening institutional, community and individual capacities to prepare for and respond to future threats including natural disasters and emergencies. UNFPA has a long-standing partnerships and humanitarian presence in the country, working in close collaboration with the federal and provincial government institutions, non-governmental organizations and other humanitarian actors to prioritize provision of lifesaving sexual and reproductive health, and gender-based violence risk mitigation and response services. Existing programmes, including for the flood response in 2022 in affected areas are being pivoted to ensure continued provision of essential services.Following the lessons learned in the current humanitarian situation in the country for response and preparedness plans, UNFPA intends to scale up the humanitarian response and preparedness actions by using different approaches. Creative thinking and innovative solutions are key to accelerate progress for women and girls around the world. During conflicts, natural disasters and public health emergencies, sexual and reproductive health needs are often overlooked – with staggering consequences. Pregnant women risk life-threatening complications without access to safe delivery and emergency obstetric care services. Women and girls may lose access to family planning services, exposing them to unintended pregnancy in perilous conditions. Equally, the risks for Gender Based Violence heightens during emergency as women and girls become more vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and HIV infection.UNFPA in Pakistan is on the ground before, during and after crises, working closely with governments, local NGOs, UN agencies and other partners to ensure that sexual reproductive health and rights and responses to gender-based violence are integrated into emergency responses. UNFPA CO delivers the humanitarian response in Afghan refugee settlements, which is considered as one of the long-lasting humanitarian crises. The flood emergency which negatively impacted the life of people in Pakistan, brought the heavy impact in the lives of women and girls and duplicated pre-existing vulnerabilities. The access and availability of uninterrupted lifesaving reproductive health services, and GBV prevention, mitigation and response is a key priority of UNFPA.In a world where fundamental human rights are challenged, we need principled and ethical staff, who embody these international norms and standards, and who will defend them courageously and with full conviction.It is against this backdrop that UNFPA is seeking candidates that transform, inspire and deliver high impact and sustained results; we need staff who are transparent, exceptional in how they manage the resources entrusted to them and who commit to deliver excellent results.Job Purpose:In the current disaster prone and protracted crisis situation, the Humanitarian Programme Specialist will provide the technical assistance to deliver UNFPA’s strategic vision on the three transformative results. The specialist will be required to provide a high-quality guidance and integrated knowledge management and programmatic support to operationalize the innovation and resilience within the country programme. Their primary role is to accelerate the humanitarian response implementation by providing innovative solutions and support initiation of models and approaches that can be scaled up and replicated. In addition, to provide capacity development to UNFPA staff and implementing partners and knowledge management for innovative humanitarian approaches in flood affected areas and in response to the dire needs of Afghan refugees and flood affected population. In close coordination with humanitarian and development unit staff, including field offices, the Specialist is required to put in motion the interagency collaboration with aim to leverage the resources for better covering UNFPA mandate areas and target population in recovery phase of the flood emergency.Qualifications And ExperienceEducation: Advanced University degree in Health, Medicine, Sociology, Anthropology, International Relations, International Development or other related fields.Knowledge and Experience:  At least 5 (five) years of increasingly responsible professional experience in humanitarian program implementation work preferably in the area of resilience building and innovative projects management aimed to improve SRH and GBV service delivery in emergencies; Substantive knowledge and practical experience in humanitarian strategy implementation; Experience in resilience programming and humanitarian development and peace nexus Knowledge of warehousing and supply chain management in humanitarian settingsGood understanding of the UN humanitarian response system, particularly in the joint programming and partnership contexts; Field experience, preferably working in a multi-cultural environment; Strong results orientation, with proven experience in using results-based management toolsGood analytical and strategic thinking and sound judgment; team building and advocacy skillsExperience in programme/project planning, design, follow-up, monitoring and evaluationStrong verbal and written communications skills are a strong asset.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?We do not believe in hiring consultants. Imagine taking your car to the repair shop for a fix, and they only have a consulting mechanic who recommends that you replace your carburetor. Who is going to do that? When we have problems with our business, we value people who can fix them and not just make pitch decks and general recommendations.Trilogy has an ever-growing portfolio of 80+ software products spanning multiple industries and geographies. We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!What You Will Be Doing Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.
What You Won’t Be Doing Provide high-level insights and recommendations - we want implementers, not consultants.Develop theoretical scenarios and try to sell potential insights to management - you will work on real business problems with real solutions.
Strategic Planning Analyst Key Responsibilities Solve the most complex issues facing the organization.
Basic Requirements Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (e.g., Economics, Finance, Mathematics, Engineering)5+ years of work experience

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you’ll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.
We're on the brink of an exhilarating journey with generative AI, and we want you to be a part of it. If you're eager to pioneer this transformation and play a pivotal role in the AI-driven future of software development, Trilogy is the place for you.What You Will Be Doing Proposing and conducting experiments with generative AI to enhance engineering processes, including problem decomposition, solution design, code generation, and advanced troubleshooting.Documenting best practices and techniques in playbooks and guides that enable others to harness the power of generative AI effectively.Using AI tools and techniques to develop and roll out actual features and products.Adopting, testing, and aggressively integrating new technologies, and standardizing a tech stack that genuinely boosts productivity.
What You Won’t Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
Director Of AI - Enhanced Software Development Key Responsibilities Leading a team of AI-first engineers, evaluating experiments, documenting findings, selecting the best methodologies, implementing them team-wide, establishing processes, and staffing the team.
Basic Requirements Minimum 5 years of experience in software development.Minimum 3 years as a primary technical contributor for a development team or software product.Extensive hands-on experience using generative AI for software engineering tasks or in a product you built.
