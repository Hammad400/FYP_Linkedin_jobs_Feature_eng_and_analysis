There are more than 300,000 refugees in the province holding proof of registration who are within the mandate of UNHCR. Many afghans are also undocumented and this has further increased due to the recent situation in Afghanistan after the take over of Taliban. Level II emergency is currently in place from 2021 until mid of 2022. UNHCR Quetta is responsible to three field locations in Chaman, Loralai and Chaghi districts. The main and official border with Afghanistan is at Chaman. Baluchistan also has a long border with Iran. Serious security incidents have occurred both in rural areas and in Quetta, in terms of insurgency, IED and armed attacks. Security situation and restriction by the military and local authorities limited access to several operational sites. This induced the need to build the national staff capacity and reliance on local partners. A National Programme Officer, NOA supports the Programme Officer, P3. UNHCR is engaged in the sectors of protection, basic services in health, education, WASH, and livelihood. There are 10 refugee villages (RV) outside of Quetta and majority of refugees are in Quetta and in rural and urban areas outside. UNHCR works closely with the Commissioner for Afghan Refugees and the various Ministries for projects in refugees and hosting community areas. As UNHCR SO is fairly delegated with authorities and due to its distance from Islamabad, it is important that the incumbent to the Programme Officer post has a previous experience in leading a Programme Unit.Living and Working Conditions:Quetta, a category E, non-family duty station, is the provincial capital of Balochistan. International staff members are largely confined to the secured guest house where they are required to live, and the office which is located about 150 meters away, both within the Chaman Housing Scheme fully secured as per SRM requirements and where most of the UN offices are located. Living and working together in such confined quarters for extended periods of time can bring an additional degree of stress, and thus the incumbent should ideally have strong interpersonal skills, and an ability to ¬øget along with colleagues of different backgrounds and opinions. A high level of sensitivity, tolerance and flexibility is important. Quetta is on a six-week R&R cycle. Medical facilities are very limited and Karachi is about ten hours by road or 1.5 hours by flight for more delicate medical needs. Flights are regularly cancelled du to weather, security and covid situation. There is only one international flight that goes to Quetta airport, about twice a week.SkillsAdditional QualificationsPG-Programme delivery management, PG-Programme Implementation and Partnerships, PG-Programme planning at country/bureau levelEducationBachelor of Arts (BA): Business Administration, Bachelor of Arts (BA): Economics, Bachelor of Arts (BA): Social ScienceCertificationsHCR Learning Program - UNHCRWork ExperienceAnnual Budget OL in Operation/Office, Number of Persons of Concern Served, Number of Workforce in Operation/Work Setting, Workforce to Supervise, Working with Persons of Concern: Asylum Seekers, Working with Persons of Concern: Others of Concern, Working with Persons of Concern: Refugees, Working with Persons of Concern: StatelessCompetenciesAccountability, Analytical thinking, Change capability & adaptability, Client & results orientation, Commitment to continuous learning, Communication, Empowering & building trust, Judgement & decision making, Managing performance, Managing resource, Negotiation & conflict resolution, Organizational awareness, Teamwork & collaborationUNHCR Salary Calculatorhttps://icsc.un.org/Home/SalaryScalesCompendium Bi-annual Compendium 2023 Part B - October 2023Additional InformationFunctional clearanceThis position doesn't require a functional clearance",

BackgroundViolence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread human rights violations worldwide, globally affecting around one in three women in her lifetime. UN Women endeavors to expand the reach and enhance the quality of services available to survivors of violence through the use of the Essential Services Package (ESP). The ESP is a global guideline to support national systems in responding to gender-based violence encompasses the core elements of health, social services, police, and justice sectors, and provides guidelines for coordination, governance, and resource estimation. During an emergency and its aftermath, access to lifesaving care and support is unpredictable, vulnerability to violence is higher, and systems that protect women and girls, including family, community, and state structures, may weaken or break down. As a consequence, the prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) increases due to the multiple risk factors created by emergencies as well as the ways in which existing gender inequalities are exacerbated by the stress and tensions within households, communities, and society.As per the worldwide climate index, Pakistan ranks as the 8th most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change. The variability in climate and weather patterns has increased the frequency of natural disasters which undermine development in Pakistan and in particular, the ability of national and local systems to respond to GBV. According to Care International‚Äôs Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) Key Findings and Recommendations on the 2022 floods, access to life-saving resources and services has been strained; the health crisis amplified; and gender-based violence has increased with time.

Organizational Setting and Work RelationshipsUNHCR's mandated responsibility for finding solutions to refugee situations has long required stronger cooperation with development partners and the inclusion of persons of concern within development planning and programming instruments, including national development programmes. Due to a variety of factors, the proportion of refugees and internally displaced persons in protracted displacement situations remains high. Moreover, the diminishing number of forcibly displaced people who have access to so-called durable solutions constitutes a worrying trend that has persisted in recent years. The increasing scale of irregular migration, large scale refugee movements, internal displacement and the costs of responding to humanitarian situations have placed forced displacement high on the global agenda. Given the complexity and protractedness of many of today¬øs forced displacement situations, often occurring in fragile contexts, awareness is growing that the humanitarian model of care and maintenance is unsustainable in the longer term and that forced displacement requires a development response to complement humanitarian assistance, address poverty and other development challenges in a sustainable and inclusive manner. DutiesFor positions in Country Operations only- Advise operations on practical research and analysis to interpret long-term political, economic and social trends that will enhance opportunities for solutions, resilience and inclusion for populations of concern to UNHCR as well as more sustainable approaches to refugee protection;- Support the operation in planning for resilience and inclusion with a clear shared vision of longer term protection and solution outcomes for people of concern that takes account of host communities and leverages the roles, resources and capacities of development partners, including International Financial Institutions, Multilateral Development Banks, and Bilateral Development donors.- Support the development of comprehensive multi-year protection and solutions plans/strategies (incl.

This would, in particular, focus on supporting the coordination of the in-country relationship with the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, especially where there is potential for specific funding directed towards UNHCR¬øs persons of concern (e.g. WB IDA sub-window for refugees and host communities or the WB Global Concessional Financing Facility).- Cooperate with development partners to assist them in incorporating the concerns of refugees, returnees and others of concern to UNHCR into the design and implementation arrangements of projects and interventions in a manner that impacts positively on protection circumstances.- Identify, commission and/or contribute to studies and analytical activities that build the conceptual framework and evidence base for comprehensive, development-oriented responses, including preparedness work, to forced displacement.- Ensure that development actors are provided relevant data to inform their planning, programming and advocacy around resilience for and inclusion of UNHCR persons of concern.For positions in Regional Bureaux only- Provide support, as detailed in the above duties for a country SDO for countries without an SDO as specified in the operational context for this position.- Support the Regional Bureau and country operations in analysing from a development perspective the potential components of longer-term situational solutions strategies, identifying the protection/resilience/solutions challenges, and the means to address these and possible regional opportunities for engagement.- Support and advise the Regional Bureau and/or operations in identifying, articulating and capitalizing development and resilience opportunities, including through pledges made by regional partners, and regional development initiatives and programmes.- Aggregate, analyse and package available knowledge and data from country operations to feed into regional and HQ policy, programme and advocacy efforts.- Ensure support and coherence, where relevant, across operations in how they engage with development actors (e.g. messaging, policies, etc.).- Interpret long-term political, economic and social trends from a situational or regional perspective that will define the opportunities for inclusion for populations of concern to UNHCR as well as more sustainable approaches to refugee protection management.- Engage with regional bodies, such as IGAD, ECOWAS, etc. to identify and advocate for entry points for inclusion in development-related fora; and,- Perform other related duties as required.Minimum QualificationsYears of Experience / Degree LevelFor P4/NOD - 9 years relevant experience with Undergraduate degree; or 8 years relevant experience with Graduate degree; or 7 years relevant experience with Doctorate degreeField(s) of EducationDevelopment Economics; Development Studies; Socio-economic Development;International Relations; Political Science; Lawor other relevant field.Certificates and/or LicensesNot specified.Relevant Job ExperienceEssentialSix (6) years of direct work experience in a large international development institution in a relevant position and of which at least two (2) years in field operations.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you‚Äôll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.

We have different business units that own these products, and Trilogy hosts business-critical functions such as finance, customer support, and hiring for all these business units. In this role, you will work with the senior stakeholders across the business units and functions to help solve the problems they face. For instance, you may work with the SVP of Finance to hire qualified accountants in one week and work with the CIO to evaluate M&A targets using a scalable model the following week.We are looking for exceptional problem solvers and brilliant thinkers to join our team. Unlike other companies, we do not judge you by arbitrary stamps, such as whether you graduated from X university or worked in a 'top' consulting firm. We want problem solvers who enjoy taking on the challenge of solving complex problems, dive deep to find the root causes of these issues, and propose and implement fixes that solve them.If you are interested in solving complex problems while gaining unparalleled experience working across business functions and units, apply today!What You Will Be Doing Conduct research and analysis to find creative solutions for issues with real business impact.Execute assignments aiming to improve the efficiency of different functions, such as Operations, Hiring, M&A, and more.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?At Trilogy, we're convinced that generative AI represents the future of coding. We see tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Code Interpreter as game-changers in the software industry, much like the Internet and Cloud Computing once were. Our vision is that significant portions of code that are written today tediously by hand will be mostly automated away by using generative AI.Why does this matter? Because with AI, you'll not only speed up the process of understanding and writing code but also produce standardized solutions, implement features more efficiently, experiment faster, and streamline testing. We believe developers working with this model will have a more rewarding job; they'll cover a broader scope and accomplish more in the same amount of time.This role is unique in our company. While our other engineering roles focus primarily on feature delivery, this position emphasizes developing a methodology for leveraging AI tools and patterns within the engineering process. The processes and methods you establish will benefit others, as they will be reused across teams.Besides this novel approach for your day-to-day work, you‚Äôll also get a chance to work on some really exciting products: Crossover - an AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants per year to find the top 1% of global remote talent.gt.school - an online education platform that uses advanced data collection, algorithms, and AI-generated content to empower students to learn at their own pace.Data-driven Sales - an initiative that leverages data and AI algorithms to streamline the sales process across a portfolio of over 100 software products.

What You Won‚Äôt Be Doing Developing completely new AI models - we are focusing our attention on reusing and/or finetuning existing models instead. Engaging in academic exercises without tangible outcomes or failing to deliver features and products.Getting stuck on a stagnant tech stack that neither changes nor innovates.
Head Of Software Development (AI-Enhanced Processes) Key Responsibilities Leading a team of AI-first engineers, evaluating experiments, documenting findings, selecting the best methodologies, implementing them team-wide, establishing processes, and staffing the team.
Basic Requirements Minimum 5 years of experience in software development.Minimum 3 years as a primary technical contributor for a development team or software product.Extensive hands-on experience using generative AI for software engineering tasks or in a product you built.
