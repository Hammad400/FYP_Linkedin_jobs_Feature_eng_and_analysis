UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. To save their lives. To defend their rights. To help them fulfill their potential.Across 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, every day, to build a better world for everyone.And we never give up.For every child, a hero!Pakistan was the sixth country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child less than one year after it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989. However, children and adolescents living in Pakistan still face acute challenges.UNICEF supports the Government of Pakistan to accelerate progress for children, work to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and help children realize their rights under the Convention on the Rights of Children. This will be made through, among others things, strong partnerships with provincial authorities, teachers and health professionals, frontline workers and social mobilizers, communities, and families, and of course, the children and adolescents themselves.In Particular, UNICEF Will Work So That Every child survives and thrives -- being in good health, immunized, protected from polio, and accessing nutritious food.Every child learns.Every child is protected from violence and exploitation and registered at birth.Every child lives in a safe and clean environment, with access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.

There are also several other government helplines run by different ministries and NGOs for gender-based violence, mental health etc. Under UNICEF’s technical assistance on the design of a case management system, Child Protection helpline guidelines have been developed and trainings delivered. However, there are no clear coordination and collaboration mechanisms between different helplines and hotlines designated for the protection of women and children. Guidance is needed to establish a coordination mechanism as to promote integrated and coordinated service provision and referrals by the existing helplines and hotlines that are already in operation, as well as to improve the responses to users of helplines.You can make a difference by executing the following tasks and deliverables as per timelines as under:Scope Of Work Map and review government and NGO-run helplines for child protection and other child-related areas in Islamabad Capital Territory:Structure and operation of child protection helplines, including staffing, training and protocols for responding to callsAccessibility including hours of operation, languages supported and promotion of the helpline to communitiesQuality and consistency of responses to calls, including the level of expertise and empathy demonstrated by helpline staff, and accuracy of advice given etcCoordination and integration of helplines with other child protection and GBV services, including referral pathways and follow-up procedures, as well as CP IMS where applicable.Use of technology and innovation to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the helplines, such as dedicated helpline IMSQuality of existing helpline guidelines and training packages against global practicesPresent recommendations to UNICEF, Ministry of Human Rights and Child Protection Advisory Committee.Conduct a training needs assessment among key helpline staff and develop a learning strategy and learning package based on the findings of the assessment.Deliver training to existing helpline staff.
