Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy‚Äôs finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don‚Äôt run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We‚Äôre different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was ‚ÄúThe Future of Work‚Äù and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don‚Äôt need to be an asynchronous work expert.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy‚Äôs finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don‚Äôt run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We‚Äôre different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was ‚ÄúThe Future of Work‚Äù and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don‚Äôt need to be an asynchronous work expert. You simply need to be hard-working and hands-on, have solid accounting and finance fundamentals (US GAAP or IFRS), and love to automate and simplify processes. We will teach you the rest!What You Will Be Doing Completing transactions, preparing reports, building quotes, invoices, and purchase orders, applying incoming payments, managing cash positions, and paying suppliersLeading with your finance systems expertise; you will guide the team with the finance systems experience you‚Äôve gained over the years and simplify the most complex tasks
What You Won‚Äôt Be Doing Project managing the work of low-level managers; we lead by doing, not by being hands-offOverseeing steady-state operations; you will never stop improving quality and productivity with deep knowledge and hard evidence
Basic RequirementsDirector of Financial Planning and Analysis key responsibilities CPA, ACA, ACCA, CIMA, CFA, MBA, or equivalent5+ years of hands-on experience in all of the following areas: Accounts Payable (or PTP), Accounts Receivable (or OTC), Accounting (or RTR), Statutory/Management ReportingRecent experience as an auditor or controller (if you haven't posted a transaction, built a financial model, or automated a process within the last year, please do not apply)Professional experience working with NetsuiteFamiliarity with generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, Claude)The ability to commit to 40 hours of work per week with a regular, predictable work schedule

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?Are you a finance systems expert and a seasoned auditor or controller? Do you prefer to get hands-on with day-to-day finance tasks, rather than delegating them to lower-level workers? When you find key discrepancies while auditing statements or reviewing business performance reports, do you insist on diving into the ERP system to find the key issue? Do you lean on AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to boost your productivity at work? If you answered yes to these questions, we are interested in meeting you.In this role, you will be part of Trilogy‚Äôs finance function, which runs over 100 acquired software companies. We don‚Äôt run each company separately. Instead, we create a standard best practice for each task and process with a single, 100% remote team. That makes this job dramatically different. You will learn more in one month here than in a year working anywhere else.Most companies consider being global and 100% remote a liability and are currently suffering through a transition forced on them by the pandemic. We‚Äôre different. In the early 2000s, we recognized that going global and remote was ‚ÄúThe Future of Work‚Äù and went all-in. It is true that moving to a global, remote environment is really hard - you need to completely replace synchronous processes with asynchronous ones, verbal communication with written, and ambiguous goals with clear task assignment and quality expectations. But once you do all that, you can unlock a 24/7, 4-shift, 4x pace of execution.You don‚Äôt need to be an asynchronous work expert. You simply need to be hard-working and hands-on, have solid accounting and finance fundamentals (US GAAP or IFRS), and love to automate and simplify processes. We will teach you the rest!What You Will Be Doing Completing transactions, preparing reports, building quotes, invoices, and purchase orders, applying incoming payments, managing cash positions, and paying suppliersLeading with your finance systems expertise; you will guide the team with the finance systems experience you‚Äôve gained over the years and simplify the most complex tasks
What You Won‚Äôt Be Doing Project managing the work of low-level managers; we lead by doing, not by being hands-offOverseeing steady-state operations; you will never stop improving quality and productivity with deep knowledge and hard evidence
Basic RequirementsExecutive Director Finance key responsibilities CPA, ACA, ACCA, CIMA, CFA, MBA, or equivalent5+ years of hands-on experience in all of the following areas: Accounts Payable (or PTP), Accounts Receivable (or OTC), Accounting (or RTR), Statutory/Management ReportingRecent experience as an auditor or controller (if you haven't posted a transaction, built a financial model, or automated a process within the last year, please do not apply)Professional experience working with NetsuiteFamiliarity with generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, Claude)The ability to commit to 40 hours of work per week with a regular, predictable work schedule
